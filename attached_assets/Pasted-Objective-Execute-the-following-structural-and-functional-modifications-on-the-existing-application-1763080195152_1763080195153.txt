Objective: Execute the following structural and functional modifications on the existing application prototype. The primary goal is to retire the Sidebar and adopt a Bottom Navigation pattern, while ensuring the application adheres to all finalized features and fixes.

1. 🔄 Critical Structural Change: Navigation Pattern
Remove Sidebar: The fixed vertical Sidebar navigation component must be removed entirely from the application's structure.

Implement Bottom Navigation Bar: Create a Fixed Bottom Navigation Bar across all main application pages (similar to a mobile tab bar).

The Bottom Bar must contain clean icons and corresponding labels for all major sections (e.g., Dashboard, Worship & Dhikr, Study, Tasks, etc.).

2. 🛡️ Layout Integrity & Localization Fixes
Button Alignment Fix (CRITICAL): The issue where action button order does not reverse must be fixed. When switching to Arabic (dir="rtl"), button groups (like the +1 Page and -1 Page buttons) must use logic (e.g., flex-row-reverse) to ensure the positive action button is correctly placed on the Right.

Project Name: Ensure the application name is correctly set to نماء | Namaa throughout the application (header, title, etc.).

Section Renaming: Confirm the renaming of the "Prayers" section to Worship & Dhikr (العبادات والأذكار).

3. 🖱️ Header Updates & Personalization
Quick Controls in Header: The Theme Toggle and Language Switch controls must be explicitly placed in the Top Header/Navbar for quick access.

Personalized Greeting: Ensure the top header displays the personalized greeting ("Welcome, [Full Name]" or "السلام عليكم يا [Full Name]") after the user signs in.

4. 🌳 Dashboard Content Fixes
Growth Tree/Summary: Ensure the Interactive Daily Growth Tree component is either properly fixed to function as intended (growing with progress) or replaced with a simple, functional daily progress summary card.

Essential Content: Confirm the full functionality and visibility of the Daily Quranic Verse and Daily Wisdom Quote in the Dashboard.

5. 🔁 Component Duplication Verification
Verify that the full Pomodoro Timer component and the Enhanced Dhikr Counter component are now present on the Dashboard, in addition to their dedicated pages, for user convenience.
