RTL/LTR Layout Fixes (CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION):

Sidebar Fix: The navigation sidebar must use dynamic positioning (fixed-right/fixed-left or equivalent conditional logic) to ensure it is fixed to the Right of the screen when dir="rtl".

Button Alignment Fix: All internal layouts and button groups must use flex-row-reverse or conditional CSS when dir="rtl" is active to ensure proper flow and alignment (e.g., action buttons are on the right).
